            Sometimes is easy to distinguish between Metal and classical. But what about all the types of sounds inbetween? Can we really confidently say what is Soft-Rock vs Reggae? Hip-hop vs Funk? Blues vs Jazz? 
            Unfortunately, genre labels don't tell us enough about a sound.

            <br><br>
            <b>Under the hood:</b> Using Data Analytics techniques (Python, Librosa), we took music samples from the GTZAN Dataset(link), stripped it of the predefined genre labels, and broke the samples down into their musical building blocks. Then we used a K-means unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster those sounds based on the relationship between the distinctive features (eg. a sound timbre, harmony, sharpness, brightness, etc). We found that various sound attributes helped to explain how certain sounds clustered together. For example: brightness, is it noisy or focused, is the timbre textured and complex or clean 
            <br><br>
            <b>The fun part</b>: Now we can upload audio files and discover more meaning behind the music. How is it related to the other sounds? What is the personality of the song and what are its characteristics?
